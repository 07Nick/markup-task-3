            <p >By Compu-Fax USA TODAY</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Protesting that he was <q>put up to the whole thing</q> by a
                local gang. Martin McFly, Junior, 17. was arrested for the theft of an undisclosed cash
                amount by Hill Valley Police this morning. The theft, which was accomplished with a stolen
                de&shy;gaussing unit, took place at the Hill Valley Payroll Substation on 9th Street at
                exactly 1:28 A.M. this morning. Police were sketchy about details, but apparently McFly set
                off a pressure sensitive alarm system which alerted authorities. McFly, the son of Martin and
                Jennifer McFly of Hilldale. accused members of a local gang for putting him up to the crime.
                Griff Tannen, spokesman for the accused youths, denied any involvement. <q>McFly’s too lowres
                for us to associate with him.</q> McFly insisted that the gang was involved and that he
                didn’t even know that he was committing a crime. <q>They told me it was simply a money making
                opportunity, and that it was entirely legal.</q> McFly will be arraigned tomorrow and will be
                tried in a data-fax court later this week.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The McFly family is no stranger to runins with the law. Martin McFly was

            <h3 class="caption">Cholesterol maybe cancer cure</h3>
            <p>By Matthew Urbanos USA TODAY</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A controversial new study by scientists at the International
                Center for Alternative Scientific Theory (ICAST) suggests that cholesterol may hold the
                key to curing cancer. The report released yesterday sent shockwaves through the medical
                community. <q>Simply put, the results of our preliminary research are stunning and
                completely unexpected,</q> said Dr. Leigh Quindara, leader of the study, in an exclusive
                interview with USA TODAY. The experimental protocol, according to Quindara and researcher
                Steve Pearson, involved two groups of rats. The control group was given a normal healthy
                diet, while the experimental group was given eggs and bacon cooked in lard and smothered
                in Hollandaise sauce. At the same time, both groups were forced to breathe polluted air
                Laden with carcinogens that was the equivalent of smoking three packs of cigarettes per
                day. After 7 months, the control group rats all had lung tumors, while the experimental
                group did not. The cholesterol levels in the experimental group were 400% greater than the
                control group. <q>It’s too soon to determine if the cholesterol was a preventative or a
                cure,</q> said Dr. Stephanie Wissler. President of ICAST. <q>It’s also possible that the
                difference in tumor occurrence was a result of the higher levels of saturated fat in the
                experimental group, which would also be startling.</q></p>
            <p class="paragraph"><q>It’s been said that everything claimed to be bad for you
                eventually turns out to be good for you,</q> said <cite>Quindara</cite>, <q>and that would
                be the case whether the anticancer effect is due to cholesterol or saturated fat.</q> The
                research suggests numerous ideas for followup studies, and upcoming trials will involve
                french fries, churros, chicken fried steak and eggnog ICAST will make the detailed data of
                their study available to anyone who requests it. <q>We want other scientists to replicate
                our experiments and build upon them to prove that we’re on the right track.</q> said
                <cite>Pearson</cite>.</p>
            <p  class="paragraph">Reactions to the report were immediate and mostly dismissive,
                including virulently negative responses from those who did not read it. <q>I don’t have to
                read a study like that to know that it’s absurd and irresponsible,</q> said cardiologist
                <cite>Dr. Nakea Tyson</cite>. <q>What are they going to come up with next? Alcohol cures
                venereal disease? Buttered popcorn improves sexual stamina? This is an organization that
                exists only to generate news headlines.</q> Dr. Glenann Godden, chief oncologist of United
                Independent Hospitals, agreed. <q>Consider the source of this research. ICAST is the group
                that spent five years to dete rmine if rust was actually a living organism of
                extra-terrestrial origin. I wouldn't be surprised if their study was funded bv the
                Butterfat Producers of America.</q></p>
            <p class="paragraph">Pearson responded that ICAST accepts no funding from special interest
                groups, businesses or trade organizations. <q>We make all of our reports public to ensure
                our integrity. and if we’re wrong, well be the first to admit it. As to the McBride Rust
                Study, it was privately funded and we conclusively proved that rust was not an alien life
                form. What's so controversial about that? It’s now settled science, and we’ve closed the
                book on a subject that was the focus of decades of conspiracy theories and barroom
                brawls.</q></p>
            <p class="paragraph">In addition to the varied reactions throughout the medical
                establishment, the price of pork futures have doubled, and the stock price of Lard Fat
                Industries of Mobile Alabama (LFIMA) closed at an historic high. <q>We’re certainly not
                recommending that people suddenly change their diets to a lardinfused cholesterol rich
                diet,</q> said <cite>Quindara</cite> as she savored a buttered croissant during our
                interview, <q>but I must admit, few things taste better than a pastry like this.</q> After
                a pause, she turned to our waitress. <q>Could 1 have another serving of bacon,
                please?</q></p>
