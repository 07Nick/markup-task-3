            <p >By&nbsp;Compu-Fax USA TODAY</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Protesting that he&nbsp;was <q>put up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the whole thing</q>
                by&nbsp;a local gang. Martin McFly, Junior, 17. was arrested for the theft
                of&nbsp;an&nbsp;undisclosed cash amount by&nbsp;Hill Valley Police this morning. The theft,
                which was accomplished with a&nbsp;stolen de&shy;gaussing unit, took place at&nbsp;the Hill
                Valley Payroll Substation on&nbsp;9th Street at exactly 1:28&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M. this morning.
                Police were sketchy about details, but apparently McFly set off a&nbsp;pressure sensitive
                alarm system which alerted authorities. McFly, the son of&nbsp;Martin and Jennifer McFly
                of&nbsp;Hilldale. accused members of&nbsp;a&nbsp;local gang for putting him
                up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the crime. Griff Tannen, spokesman for the accused youths, denied any
                involvement. <q>McFly&rsquo;s too lowres for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;associate with him.</q> McFly
                insisted that the gang was involved and that he didn&rsquo;t even know that he&nbsp;was
                committing a&nbsp;crime. <q>They told me&nbsp;it&nbsp;was simply a&nbsp;money making
                opportunity, and that it&nbsp;was entirely legal.</q> McFly will be&nbsp;arraigned tomorrow
                and will be tried in&nbsp;a&nbsp;data-fax court later this week.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The McFly family is&nbsp;no&nbsp;stranger to&nbsp;runins with the law.
                Martin McFly was involved in&nbsp;a&nbsp;drag racing accident involving an&nbsp;innocent

            <h3 class="caption">Cholesterol maybe cancer cure</h3>
            <p>By&nbsp;Matthew Urbanos USA TODAY</p>
            <p>By&nbsp;Matthew Urbanos USA TODAY</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A&nbsp;controversial new study by&nbsp;scientists at&nbsp;the International
                Center for Alternative Scientific Theory (ICAST) suggests that cholesterol may hold the
                key to&nbsp;curing cancer. The report released yesterday sent shockwaves through the medical
                community. <q>Simply put, the results of&nbsp;our preliminary research are stunning and
                completely unexpected,</q> said Dr. Leigh Quindara, leader of&nbsp;the study,
                in&nbsp;an&nbsp;exclusive interview with USA TODAY. The experimental protocol, according
                to&nbsp;Quindara and researcher Steve Pearson, involved two groups of&nbsp;rats. The control
                group was given a&nbsp;normal healthy diet, while the experimental group was given eggs and
                bacon cooked in&nbsp;lard and smothered in&nbsp;Hollandaise sauce. At&nbsp;the same time,
                both groups were forced to&nbsp;breathe polluted air Laden with carcinogens that was the
                equivalent of&nbsp;smoking three packs of&nbsp;cigarettes per day. After 7&nbsp;months, the
                control group rats all had lung tumors, while the experimental group did not. The
                cholesterol levels in&nbsp;the experimental group were 400% greater than the control group.
                <q>It&rsquo;s too soon to&nbsp;determine if&nbsp;the cholesterol was a&nbsp;preventative
                or&nbsp;a cure,</q> said Dr. Stephanie Wissler. President of&nbsp;ICAST. <q>It&rsquo;s also
                possible that the difference in&nbsp;tumor occurrence was a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;the higher
                levels of&nbsp;saturated fat in&nbsp;the experimental group, which would also
                be&nbsp;startling.</q></p>
            <p class="paragraph"><q>It&rsquo;s been said that everything claimed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;bad for you
                eventually turns out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;good for you,</q> said <cite>Quindara</cite>, <q>and
                that would be&nbsp;the case whether the anticancer effect is&nbsp;due to&nbsp;cholesterol
                or&nbsp;saturated fat.</q> The research suggests numerous ideas for followup studies, and
                upcoming trials will involve french fries, churros, chicken fried steak and eggnog ICAST
                will make the detailed data of their study available to&nbsp;anyone who requests&nbsp;it.
                <q>We&nbsp;want other scientists to&nbsp;replicate our experiments and build upon them
                to&nbsp;prove that we&rsquo;re on&nbsp;the right track.</q> said<cite>Pearson</cite>.</p>
            <p  class="paragraph">Reactions to&nbsp;the report were immediate and mostly dismissive,
                including virulently negative responses from those who did not read&nbsp;it.
                <q>I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t have to read a&nbsp;study like that to&nbsp;know that it&rsquo;s
                absurd and irresponsible,</q> said cardiologist<cite>Dr. Nakea Tyson</cite>. <q>What are
                they going to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with next? Alcohol cures venereal disease? Buttered popcorn
                improves sexual stamina? This is&nbsp;an&nbsp;organization that exists only to&nbsp;generate
                news headlines.</q> Dr. Glenann Godden, chief oncologist of&nbsp;United Independent
                Hospitals, agreed. <q>Consider the source of&nbsp;this research. ICAST is&nbsp;the group that
                spent five years to&nbsp;dete rmine if&nbsp;rust was actually a&nbsp;living organism of
                extra-terrestrial origin. I&nbsp;wouldn&rsquo;t be&nbsp;surprised if&nbsp;their study was
                funded bv&nbsp;the Butterfat Producers of&nbsp;America.</q></p>
            <p class="paragraph">Pearson responded that ICAST accepts no&nbsp;funding from special interest
                groups, businesses or&nbsp;trade organizations. <q>We&nbsp;make all of&nbsp;our reports
                public to&nbsp;ensure our integrity. and if&nbsp;we&rsquo;re wrong, well be&nbsp;the first
                to&nbsp;admit&nbsp;it. As&nbsp;to&nbsp;the McBride Rust Study, it&nbsp;was privately funded
                and we&nbsp;conclusively proved that rust was not an&nbsp;alien life form. What&rsquo;s
                so&nbsp;controversial about that? It&rsquo;s now settled science, and we&rsquo;ve closed the
                book on&nbsp;a&nbsp;subject that was the focus of&nbsp;decades of&nbsp;conspiracy theories
                and barroom brawls.</q></p>
            <p class="paragraph">In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the varied reactions throughout the medical
                establishment, the price of&nbsp;pork futures have doubled, and the stock price of&nbsp;Lard
                Fat Industries of&nbsp;Mobile Alabama (LFIMA) closed at&nbsp;an&nbsp;historic high.
                <q>We&rsquo;re certainly not recommending that people suddenly change their diets
                to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lardinfused cholesterol rich diet,</q> said <cite>Quindara</cite> as&nbsp;she
                savored a&nbsp;buttered croissant during our interview, <q>but&nbsp;I must admit, few things
                taste better than a&nbsp;pastry like this.</q> After a&nbsp;pause, she turned to&nbsp;our
                waitress. <q>Could 1&nbsp;have another serving of&nbsp;bacon, please?</q></p>
